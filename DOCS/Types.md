# Types
Impulse has the basics. we plan to implement more types such as booleans, pointers & addresses, floats, etc
<br>
```
int -> 32 bit integer
string -> structure array of chars and length
_ -> void
```

## Ideas
```
bool -> boolean
f64 -> 64 bit float
[1 2 3 4] -> array
|"hello" 10| -> tuple
```
