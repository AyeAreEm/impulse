# Branching

## If statement
Similar syntax to C

```
int x: 10;
if (x = 10) {
    # do smth
} orif (x = 9) {
    # do smth
} else {
    # do smth
}
```

`orif` is the same as `else if` or `elif`. The equality operator is just one `=` since the assigment operator is `:`<br>
`or` and `and` are used to chained booleans, works the same as C's `||` and `&&`.
