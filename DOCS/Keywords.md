# Keywords
The aim is for Impulse to feel simplicity and as such, there shouldn't be an absurd amount of keyword *cough cough* like C++ *cough coubh*

```
and or

if orif else

switch case fall

true false

loop for

break continue return

struct enum

defer

int uint usize char i64 u64 i32 u32 i16 u16 i8 u8 f64 f32 bool _ $

typeid any let

@import @c @inline @shared @default @garbage @mut
```

That's all the keywords.<br>
Note: I included `_` and `$` because those are valid names (variable, function, etc) in GCC
