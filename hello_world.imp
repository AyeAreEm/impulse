# what happened this commit:

# refactored generics to be actual types instead of strings. no difference in how you write the code, just better for the compiler
# start work on a file system library `base/fs.imp`
# allow for CEmbeds as values. `int int_max :: @c [INT_MAX];`. This is new, will refactor base to use this more

@import "base/fs.imp";

_ main :: () {
    string content: fs.read_file_string("./test.txt");
    defer string.dealloc(&content);

    println("%s" content.data);
}
